      "content"     : "OverviewSorting resistors is a tedious task. Reading the color bands becomes harder when the color of the resistor has low constrast with the color bands. A solution for sorting resistors is to use a multimeter with an intgrated ohm meter. The following design process is for an ohm meter that displays the value, nearest standard value, and percent error of the resistor.MeasurmentStandard ValuesResistor values are spaced apart on a logorithmic scale. The E-series denotes that every decade is divided by that number. The following formula, sourced from Jeremy Webbâ€™s website, is used to calculate the standard resistor values.\\(\\begin{align}R = d \\ast 10^{\\frac{i}{N}},\\end{align}\\)\\(\\begin{align}\\begin{array}{r | l}\\\\ &amp; d = \\text{decade multiplier: 10, 100, 1k,} \\dots\\\\ \\text{where} &amp; N = \\text{E-series (tolerance %): 12, 24, 48, 96}\\\\ &amp; i = 0 \\dots N-1\\end{array}\\end{align}\\)ErrorImplementationUPDATES COMING SOON"
